# Territory Commands
BlockTavern has added Enclosure territory system, allowing players to use wooden hoes to establish protection zones for themselves to prevent other players from causing damage. Players can set some basic properties within their territory, such as name, access permissions, etc.

::: tip Tip
If you don't have GUI display, you need to download this Enclosure MOD: [Click to Download](/assets/GameplayGuide/enclosure-order/[领地]enclosure-fabric-0.4.5+1.21.jar) 
Place it in the mods folder and restart the game.
